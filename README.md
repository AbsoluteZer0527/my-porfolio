My porfolio

## devlog: 8/2/25
- trying to not copy and paste from LLM, learning by myself. I would say it's hard to get started but it soon gets interesting.
- created this simple nav bar. A great way to get started
- I learned that the reason that inside {} is when we want to execute JavaScript code. Wow I didn't know that since I skipped all the react lessons lol. 
- Still need learn how to use arrow functions properly. () => {} need to return explicitly, but () => () automatically returns JSX.
